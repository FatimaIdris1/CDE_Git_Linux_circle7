## Project Overview  

This project was a group assignment focused on analyzing the **Parch and Posey dataset**.  
The objective was to explore sales, accounts, sales representatives, regions, and web events data using **PostgreSQL**.  
As a team, we collaborated to design queries that answered key business questions and structured our findings into a presentation.  

The work was carried out by **CDE Circle 7** members:  
- Fatima Idris  
- Temitope Fafure  
- Ayodeji Agunbiade  
- Godsgift Olomu  
- Keletso Ntseno  

The project demonstrates teamwork, SQL querying, and analysis skills applied to a real-world business dataset.
