## Project Overview  

This project was completed as part of the **CDE Data Engineering Bootcamp** under the **Git and Linux module**.  
The task focused on analyzing the **Parch and Posey dataset** to explore sales, accounts, sales representatives, regions, and web events data using **PostgreSQL**.  

As a team, we collaborated to design SQL queries that answered key business questions and structured our findings into a presentation.  

The work was carried out by **CDE Circle 7** members:  
- Fatima Idris  
- Temitope Fafure  
- Ayodeji Agunbiade  
- Godsgift Olomu  
- Keletso Ntseno  

This project demonstrates teamwork, SQL querying, version control with Git, and  analysis skills applied to a real-world business dataset.
