# Competitive Intelligence Report: Parch & Posey Analysis

## Project Overview
As CoreDataEngineers expands into sales and services, we conducted a detailed analysis of Parch and Posey's operational data.

## Data Structure
Our analysis utilized four primary data tables:

- **orders** - Transaction records including product quantities and revenue
- **regions** - Geographic sales territories
- **sales_reps** - Sales personnel details and regional assignments

## Key Research Questions
Our SQL queries addressed these critical business questions:

1. Which customers generate the highest revenue?
2. How is their client base distributed geographically?
3. Which sales professionals manage the largest portfolios?
4. What are the sales patterns across different product categories?
5. What is their typical transaction size?
